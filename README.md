# facial-expression-recognition
Facial expression recognition (FER) is a machine learning task that involves classifying human emotions based on facial images. Using PyTorch, the process typically begins with pre-processing steps such as face detection and alignment, often performed using tools like OpenCV or Dlib.
The feature extraction is commonly handled by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with pre-trained models like ResNet or MobileNet frequently used for transfer learning to optimize performance. Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the model's ability to generalize across variations in lighting, pose, and subtle differences in expressions.
FER has applications in areas such as emotion analysis, human-computer interaction, and behavior monitoring. While challenges like data imbalance and expression ambiguity remain, advancements in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch make it possible to develop efficient and scalable solutions
